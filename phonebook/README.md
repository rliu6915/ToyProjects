# Phonebook

This project includes frontend. It adds names and numbers to phonebook. It prevents the user from being able to add names that already exist in the phonebook by showing alert. It fetches the data from the server using axios library and effect hook. It communicates between frontend and backend by seperating the codes into their own modules in services folder. It can delete entries from phonebook by showing a window to confirm you want to delete. It can check if the person is existing in the server when adding a new entry. If the person exists, it will show a window asking you to confirm and replace the old information with the new one. When a person is added or a number is changed or a person is deleted, show notification.
