# Phonebook

This project includes frontend. It adds names and numbers to phonebook. It prevents the user from being able to add names that already exist in the phonebook by showing alert. It fetches the data from the server using axios library and effect hook. It communicates between frontend and backend by seperating the codes into their own modules in services folder. It can delete entries from phonebook by showing a window to confirm you want to delete.
